# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Study Guide for the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

- I was motivated by my desire to learn how to program to build this page.
- I built this project so that I could have an easily accessible study guide.
- This solved the problem of how to consolidate useful information about multiple topics onto one page.
- I learned how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git are all connected.
